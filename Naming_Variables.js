Naming variables

Variable names should be descriptive and easy to understand. Don't be afraid to write long variable names. Now, there are some rules to keep in mind while writing names for variables. 

The names of variables can only contain letters, numbers, underscores _ and dollar signs $. They also must not start with a number. For example:

const number = 5;	valid
const you&i = 'love';	invalid
const HeUiOna4 = true;	valid
const 4times = false	invalid
const $time_flies = true;	valid
Naming conventions
You will often write variable names that contain multiple words. How should you connect the words? 

The most popular way is called Camel Case. It consists of starting with lowercase letters and capitalizing the first letter of every word after the first word. Valid examples of  Camel Case are

userPassword
shouldTurnOnLightSwitch
secondList
number. 
Some also write variable names with underscores like 

user_password
should_turn_on_light_switch
second_list
number 
In JavaScript, it is best to use the Camel Case naming convention, as most built-in commands are written that way.


Challenge

Easy
Clean up this code and these variables. Delete the variables that don't have valid names. Also delete the variables that aren't written in Camel Case.
